# AT Challenge
This repo is being set up to communicate results within a team for Analyze This's AI challenge.

## To-Do

1. Hand-Clean Training data in a reasonably efficient way
    * Use the trained algorithm to help prioritize labels
	    * Prioritize characters with no particular class?
	    * Prioritize characters with high confidence in wrong-label?
    * Explore tools like Snorkel for assisting the hand labeling process
2. Explore Generative Models
	1. Auto-Encoders, and visualization of latent space
	2. Generative-Adversarial networks
